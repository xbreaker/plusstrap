Plusstrap provides simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions. In other words, it's a front-end toolkit for faster, more beautiful web development. It's forked from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) and maintained by [xbreaker](http://twitter.com/xbreaker).

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Plusstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
